        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li> <b>Meat:</b> Steak This recipe calls for flank steak because it's tender and flavorful. You can also use skirt steak or hanger steak. </li>
            <li> <b>Soy Sauce:</b> Salty, umami-rich soy sauce is the base of this beef bulgogi marinade. </li>
            <li> <b>Sugar:</b> A couple tablespoons of white sugar lends sweetness, balancing the other savory flavors. </li>
            <li> <b>Green Onion and Garlic:</b> Chopped green onion and minced garlic add flavor to the marinade, without overpowering the other ingredients. </li>
            <li> <b>Sesame Seeds:</b> You can use toasted or un-toasted sesame seeds.</li>
            <li> <b>Sesame Oil:</b> Use good quality sesame oil for the best flavor. </li>
            <li><b>Pepper:</b> Finish strong with a touch of black pepper. If you used low-sodium soy sauce, you can also add a pinch of salt here if you want.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li> <b>Marinate the Steak:</b> Place the flank steak in a shallow bowl. In a separate bowl, combine the rest of the ingredients and whisk until blended. Pour the marinade over the steak â€” make sure the meat is completely covered. Cover the bowl and allow the beef to marinate in the fridge for about an hour.</li>
            <li> <b>Grill the Steak:</b> On a lightly oiled grill set to high heat, cook the beef until it's charred and completely cooked through. This should take about 1 or 2 minutes on each side.</li>
        </ol>
