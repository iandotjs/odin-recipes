    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li> <b>Meat:</b> This lasagna recipe starts with a pound of ground meat (½ pound ground pork, ½ pound lean ground beef).</li>
        <li> <b>Onion:</b> A diced onion is cooked until translucent with the ground meat.</li>
        <li> <b>Canned tomatoes:</b> You'll need a can of tomato sauce and a can of crushed tomatoes.</li>
        <li> <b>Fresh herbs:</b> For fresh flavor, chop two tablespoons of parsley and crush one clove of garlic.</li>
        <li> <b>Sugar:</b> A dash of sugar balances out all of the acidity from the tomatoes.</li>
        <li> <b>Spices and seasonings:</b> This homemade lasagna is seasoned with dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper.</li>
        <li> <b>Noodles:</b> Of course, you'll need lasagna noodles! This recipe calls for uncooked noodles, but you can use the oven-ready variety to save time.</li>
        <li> <b>Cheese:</b> The cheese layer is made up of cottage cheese and Parmesan. You'll also need shredded mozzarella.</li>
        <li> <b>Eggs:</b> Eggs make the cheese layer extra creamy. Plus, they act as a binding agent (which means they hold the layer together).</li>
    </ul>
